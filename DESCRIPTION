Description: It includes a custom gradient boost regression tree function (gbrt), which is designed to train an gradient boost regression tree model and then make predictions. Then we compare the performance of the gradient boost regression model with a standard GBM model using the dataset penguins. Finally we write a cross-validation function (gbrt_cv) for hyperparameter tuning of learning rate.
